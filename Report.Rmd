md.pattern(birth)

tempbirth<- mice(birth, m=5, method = "pmm", seed=500)
#summary(tempbirth)

#modelFit1 <- with(tempbirth,lm(formula = wt ~ parity + mage + mht + mwt + feth + fage + time + 
#    parity:fage + parity:mht))
#summary(pool(modelFit1))

birth1<- complete(tempbirth, 1)

birth3<- complete(tempbirth, 3)
birth4<- complete(tempbirth, 4)
birth5<- complete(tempbirth, 5)
